How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I think encapsulation is one of the primary ways to create and write code, that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. Thinking back to Project One, separating the code into different sections made it easier to segment what block of code did. Using standard dictionary input along with a standard format made it so the code was easily readable and easy to reproduce. With my current career trajectory, I will not be using Python or any code writing modules in the future.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach problems as a computer scientist in pieces. For the database or dashboard as example the systems had to be enabled to interact with each other, so building each piece at a time was the way to go. I approach all projects the same in every course. Break down each issue in pieces and wrap them all together at the end. I would use the same techniques I used in this course if I had to create another database for a client. Understanding what they want their system to be able to do and tackle it in segmented pieces, iterating every step of the way.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientist create/build application, tools and widgets on computers. There are many avenues to which this is done, there are full stack developers, data scientists, software developers and app developers. For a company like Grazioso Salvare, the next project the dashboard attributes will be included. The dashboard will be user friendly and intuitive that will aid in making it queries quick and without error. I will complete the project for the next company by writing/creating database interface logic and the dashboard.
